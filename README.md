# Maguire-in-the-Middle
Maguire in the Middle is a multiplayer game. The game has 5 players in each round. There is a player in the middle, who is the 'Maguire'. The other four players are on four sides, each having a paddle board (like the ones in DX-Ball game). There is a ball in the board, which keeps moving around following physical laws, rebounding off walls and the 4 players’ paddles. The four players on the sides pass the ball to each other. 
Each player has a defined region where he can move his paddle around to control/direct the ball in a manner such that Maguire can’t intercept easily. Maguire will gain a point whenever he successfully intercepts a pass. Each player becomes Maguire in turn. Each round consists of 30 seconds time limit. The player with the most interception in his 30 seconds of play time being Maguire will have scored the most points, and thus, will win. 
The time and points are shown using a 16x2 LCD display. Rest of the gameplay is played in a 16x16 bicolor LED Dot Matrix, and controlled by an Arduino. The players control their game using IR sensors, Joysticks and a Gyroscope.
